                            <br><b>The French neuroscientist was watching a macaque monkey as it hunched
                                aggressively</b> at one end of a treadmill.
                            His team had used a blade to slice halfway through the animal’s spinal cord, paralyzing its
                            right leg.
                            Now Courtine wanted to prove he could get the monkey walking again. To do it, he and
                            colleagues had installed a recording device beneath its skull, touching its motor cortex,
                            and sutured a pad of flexible electrodes around the animal’s spinal cord, below the injury.
                            A wireless connection joined the two electronic devices.
                            <br>
                            <br>The result: a system that read the monkey’s intention to move and then transmitted it
                            immediately in the form of bursts of electrical stimulation to its spine.
                            Soon enough, the monkey’s right leg began to move. Extend and flex. Extend and flex. It
                            hobbled forward. “The monkey was thinking, and then boom, it was walking,” recalls an
                            exultant Courtine, a professor with Switzerland’s École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.
                            <br>
                            <br>In recent years, lab animals and a few people have controlled computer cursors or
                            robotic arms with their thoughts, thanks to a brain implant wired to machines.
                            Now researchers are taking a significant next step toward reversing paralysis once and for
                            all. They are wirelessly connecting the brain-reading technology directly to electrical
                            stimulators on the body, creating what Courtine calls a “neural bypass” so that people’s
                            thoughts can again move their limbs.
                            <br>
                            <br>At Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, a middle-aged quadriplegic—he can’t
                            move anything but his head and shoulder—agreed to let doctors place two recording implants
                            in his brain, of the same type Courtine used in the monkeys.
                            Made of silicon, and smaller than a postage stamp, they bristle with a hundred hair-size
                            metal probes that can “listen” as neurons fire off commands.
                            <br>
                            <br>To complete the bypass, the Case team, led by Robert Kirsch and Bolu Ajiboye, also slid
                            more than 16 fine electrodes into the muscles of the man’s arm and hand. In videos of the
                            experiment, the volunteer can be seen slowly raising his arm with the help of a
                            spring-loaded arm rest, and willing his hand to open and close. He even raises a cup with a
                            straw to his lips. Without the system, he can’t do any of that.
                            <br>
                            <br>Just try sitting on your hands for a day. That will give you an idea of the shattering
                            consequences of spinal cord injury. You can’t scratch your nose or tousle a child’s hair.
                            “But if you have this,” says Courtine, reaching for a red espresso cup and raising it to his
                            mouth with an actor’s exaggerated motion, “it changes your life.”
                            <br>
                            <br>The Case results, pending publication in a medical journal, are a part of a broader
                            effort to use implanted electronics to restore various senses and abilities. Besides
                            treating paralysis, scientists hope to use so-called neural prosthetics to reverse blindness
                            with chips placed in the eye, and maybe restore memories lost to Alzheimer’s disease (see
                            “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2013: Memory Implants”).
                            <br>And they know it could work. Consider cochlear implants, which use a microphone to relay
                            signals directly to the auditory nerve, routing around non-working parts of the inner ear.
                            Videos of wide-eyed deaf children hearing their mothers for the first time go viral on the
                            Internet every month. More than 250,000 cases of deafness have been treated.

                    <p><b>Roman Mugriyev was driving his long-haul 18-wheeler down a two-lane Texas highway</b> when he
                        saw an oncoming car drift into his lane just a few hundred feet ahead.
                        There was a ditch to his right and more oncoming cars to his left, so there was little for him
                        to do but hit his horn and brake.
                        “I could hear the man who taught me to drive telling me what he always said was rule number one:
                        ‘Don’t hurt anybody,’” Mugriyev recalls.
                        <br>
                        <br>But it wasn’t going to work out that way. The errant car collided with the front of
                        Mugriyev’s truck.
                        It shattered his front axle, and he struggled to keep his truck and the wrecked car now fused to
                        it from hitting anyone else as it barreled down the road.
                        After Mugriyev finally came to a stop, he learned that the woman driving the car had been killed
                        in the collision.
                        <br>
                        <br>Could a computer have done better at the wheel? Or would it have done worse?
                        <br>
                        <br>We will probably find out in the next few years, because multiple companies are now testing
                        self-driving trucks.
                        Although many technical problems are still unresolved, proponents claim that self-driving trucks
                        will be safer and less costly.
                        “This system often drives better than I do,” says Greg Murphy, who’s been a professional truck
                        driver for 40 years.
                        He now serves as a safety backup driver during tests of self-driving trucks by Otto, a San
                        Francisco company that outfits trucks with the equipment needed to drive themselves.
                        <br>
                        <br>At first glance, the opportunities and challenges posed by self-driving trucks might seem to
                        merely echo those associated with self-driving cars.
                        But trucks aren’t just long cars. For one thing, the economic rationale for self-driving trucks
                        might be even stronger than the one for driverless cars.
                        Autonomous trucks can coördinate their movements to platoon closely together over long stretches
                        of highway, cutting down on wind drag and saving on fuel.
                        And letting the truck drive itself part of the time figures to help truckers complete their
                        routes sooner.
                        <br>
                        <br>But the technological obstacles facing autonomous trucks are higher than the ones for
                        self-driving cars.
                        Otto and other companies will need to demonstrate that sensors and code can match the
                        situational awareness of a professional trucker—skills honed by years of
                        experience and training in piloting an easily destabilized juggernaut, with the momentum of 25
                        Honda Accords, in the face of confusing road hazards, poor surface conditions, and unpredictable
                        car drivers.
                        <br>
                        <br>And perhaps most important, if self-driving trucks do take hold, they figure to be more
                        controversial than self-driving cars. At a time when our politics and economy
                        are already being upended by the threats that automation poses to jobs (see “The Relentless Pace
                        of Automation”), self-driving trucks will affect an enormous number of blue-collar workers.
                        There are 1.7 million trucking jobs in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
                        Technology is unlikely to replace truckers entirely anytime soon.
                        But it will almost certainly alter the nature of the job, and not necessarily in ways that all
                        would welcome.

                        <b>Shortly after walking through the door at Face++, </b>a Chinese startup valued at roughly a
                        billion dollars, I see my face, unshaven and looking a bit jet-lagged, flash up on a large
                        screen near the entrance.
                        <br>
                        <br>Having been added to a database, my face now provides automatic access to the building. It
                        can also be used to monitor my movements through each room inside.
                        As I tour the offices of Face++ (pronounced “face plus plus”), located in a suburb of Beijing, I
                        see it appear on several more screens, automatically captured from countless angles by the
                        company’s software.
                        On one screen a video shows the software tracking 83 different points on my face simultaneously.
                        It’s a little creepy, but undeniably impressive.
                        <br>
                        <br>Over the past few years, computers have become incredibly good at recognizing faces, and the
                        technology is expanding quickly in China in the interest of both surveillance and convenience.
                        Face recognition might transform everything from policing to the way people interact every day
                        with banks, stores, and transportation services.
                        <br>
                        <br>Technology from Face++ is already being used in several popular apps. It is possible to
                        transfer money through Alipay, a mobile payment app used by more than 120 million people in
                        China, using only your face as credentials. Meanwhile, Didi, China’s dominant ride-hailing
                        company, uses the Face++ software to let passengers confirm that the person behind the wheel is
                        a legitimate driver. (A “liveness” test, designed to prevent anyone from duping the system with
                        a photo, requires people being scanned to move their head or speak while the app scans them.)
                        <br>
                        <br>TFacial recognition has existed for decades, but only now is it accurate enough to be used
                        in secure financial transactions. The new versions use deep learning, an artificial-intelligence
                        technique that is especially effective for image recognition because it makes a computer zero in
                        on the facial features that will most reliably identify a person (see “10 Breakthrough
                        Technologies 2013: Deep Learning”).
                        <br>“The face recognition market is huge,” says Shiliang Zhang, an assistant professor at Peking
                        University who specializes in machine learning and image processing. Zhang heads a lab not far
                        from the offices of Face++. When I arrived, his students were working away furiously in a dozen
                        or so cubicles. “In China security is very important, and we also have lots of people,” he says.
                        “Lots of companies are working on it.”
                        <br>One such company is Baidu, which operates China’s most popular search engine, along with
                        other services. Baidu researchers have published papers showing that their software rivals most
                        humans in its ability to recognize a face. In January, the company proved this by taking part in
                        a TV show featuring people who are remarkably good at identifying adults from their baby photos.
                        Baidu’s system outshined them.
                        <br>
                        <br>Now Baidu is developing a system that lets people pick up rail tickets by showing their
                        face. The company is already working with the government of Wuzhen, a historic tourist
                        destination, to provide access to many of its attractions without a ticket. This involves
                        scanning tens of thousands of faces in a database to find a match, which Baidu says it can do
                        with 99 percent accuracy.
                        <br>
                        <br>Jie Tang, an associate professor at Tsinghua University who advised the founders of Face++
                        as students, says the convenience of the technology is what appeals most to people in China.
                        Some apartment complexes use facial recognition to provide access, and shops and restaurants are
                        looking to the technology to make the customer experience smoother. Not only can he pay for
                        things this way, he says, but the staff in some coffee shops are now alerted by a facial
                        recognition system when he walks in: “They say, ‘Hello, Mr. Tang.’”
