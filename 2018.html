                        <p><b>While 3-D printing has been around for decades,</b> it has remained largely in the domain
                            of hobbyists and designers producing one-off prototypes.
                            And printing objects with anything other than plastics—in particular, metal—has been
                            expensive and painfully slow.
                            <br>
                            <br> Now, however, it’s becoming cheap and easy enough to be a potentially practical way of
                            manufacturing parts.
                            If widely adopted, it could change the way we mass-produce many products.
                            <br>
                            <br>In the short term, manufacturers wouldn’t need to maintain large inventories—they could
                            simply print an object, such as a replacement part for an aging car, whenever someone needs
                            it.
                            In the longer term, large factories that mass-produce a limited range of parts might be
                            replaced by smaller ones that make a wider variety, adapting to customers’ changing needs.
                            <br>The technology can create lighter, stronger parts, and complex shapes that aren’t
                            possible with conventional metal fabrication methods. It can also provide more precise
                            control of the microstructure of metals. In 2017, researchers from the Lawrence Livermore
                            National Laboratory announced they had developed a 3-D-printing method for creating
                            stainless-steel parts twice as strong as traditionally made ones.
                            <br>
                            <br>Also in 2017, 3-D-printing company Markforged, a small startup based outside Boston,
                            released the first 3-D metal printer for under $100,000.
                            <br>
                            <br>Another Boston-area startup, Desktop Metal, began to ship its first metal prototyping
                            machines in December 2017. It plans to begin selling larger machines, designed for
                            manufacturing, that are 100 times faster than older metal printing methods.
                            <br>
                            <br>The printing of metal parts is also getting easier. Desktop Metal now offers software
                            that generates designs ready for 3-D printing. Users tell the program the specs of the
                            object they want to print, and the software produces a computer model suitable for printing.
                            <br>
                            <br>GE, which has long been a proponent of using 3-D printing in its aviation products (see
                            “10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2013: Additive Manufacturing”), has a test version of its
                            new metal printer that is fast enough to make large parts. The company plans to begin
                            selling the printer in 2018. —Erin Winick

                    <p><b>In a breakthrough that redefines how life can be created, </b>Bembryologists working at the
                        University of Cambridge in the UK have grown realistic-looking mouse embryos using only stem
                        cells.
                        No egg. No sperm. Just cells plucked from another embryo.
                        <br>
                        <br>The researchers placed the cells carefully in a three-dimensional scaffold and watched,
                        fascinated, as they started communicating and lining up into the distinctive bullet shape of a
                        mouse embryo several days old.
                        <br>
                        <br>“We know that stem cells are magical in their powerful potential of what they can do. We did
                        not realize they could self-organize so beautifully or perfectly,” Magdelena Zernicka­-Goetz,
                        who headed the team, told an interviewer at the time.
                        <br>
                        <br>Zernicka-Goetz says her “synthetic” embryos probably couldn’t have grown into mice.
                        Nonetheless, they’re a hint that soon we could have mammals born without an egg at all.
                        <br>
                        <br> That isn’t Zernicka-Goetz’s goal. She wants to study how the cells of an early embryo begin
                        taking on their specialized roles. The next step, she says, is to make an artificial embryo out
                        of human stem cells, work that’s being pursued at the University of Michigan and Rockefeller
                        University.
                        <br>
                        <br> Synthetic human embryos would be a boon to scientists, letting them tease apart events
                        early in development. And since such embryos start with easily manipulated stem cells, labs will
                        be able to employ a full range of tools, such as gene editing, to investigate them as they grow.
                        <br>
                        <br> Artificial embryos, however, pose ethical questions. What if they turn out to be
                        indistinguishable from real embryos? How long can they be grown in the lab before they feel
                        pain? We need to address those questions before the science races ahead much further,
                        bioethicists say. —Antonio Regalado

                        <b> Numerous smart-city schemes have run into delays, dialed down their ambitious goals, </b>or
                        priced out everyone except the super-wealthy. A new project in Toronto, called Quayside, is
                        hoping to change that pattern of failures by rethinking an urban neighborhood from the ground up
                        and rebuilding it around the latest digital technologies.
                        <br>
                        <br> Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs, based in New York City, is collaborating with the Canadian
                        government on the high-tech project, slated for Toronto’s industrial waterfront.
                        <br>
                        <br> One of the project’s goals is to base decisions about design, policy, and technology on
                        information from an extensive network of sensors that gather data on everything from air quality
                        to noise levels to people’s activities.

                        The plan calls for all vehicles to be autonomous and shared. Robots will roam underground doing
                        menial chores like delivering the mail. Sidewalk Labs says it will open access to the software
                        and systems it’s creating so other companies can build services on top of them, much as people
                        build apps for mobile phones.
                        <br>
                        <br>The company intends to closely monitor public infrastructure, and this has raised concerns
                        about data governance and privacy. But Sidewalk Labs believes it can work with the community and
                        the local government to alleviate those worries.
                        <br>
                        <br> “What’s distinctive about what we’re trying to do in Quayside is that the project is not
                        only extraordinarily ambitious but also has a certain amount of humility,” says Rit Aggarwala,
                        the executive in charge of Sidewalk Labs’ urban-systems planning. That humility may help
                        Quayside avoid the pitfalls that have plagued previous smart-city initiatives.
                        <br>
                        <br>Other North American cities are already clamoring to be next on Sidewalk Labs’ list,
                        according to Waterfront Toronto, the public agency overseeing Quayside’s development. “San
                        Francisco, Denver, Los Angeles, and Boston have all called asking for introductions,” says the
                        agency’s CEO, Will Fleissig. —Elizabeth Woyke
