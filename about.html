                        <p><b>Emerging technologies</b> are technologies whose development, practical applications, or
                            both are still largely unrealized, such that they are figuratively emerging into prominence
                            from a background of nonexistence or obscurity.
                            These technologies are new, such as various applications of biotechnology including gene
                            therapy (which date to circa 1990 but even today have large undeveloped potential).
                            Emerging technologies are often perceived as capable of changing the status quo.
                            <br>Emerging technologies are characterized by radical novelty (in application even if not
                            in origins), relatively fast growth, coherence, prominent impact, and uncertainty and
                            ambiguity.
                            In other words, an emerging technology can be defined as "a radically novel and relatively
                            fast growing technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time
                            and with the potential to exert
                            a considerable impact on the socio-economic domain(s) which is observed in terms of the
                            composition of actors, institutions and patterns of interactions among those, along with the
                            associated knowledge production processes.
                            Its most prominent impact, however, lies in the future and so in the emergence phase is
                            still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous."
                            <br>Emerging technologies include a variety of technologies such as educational technology,
                            information technology, nanotechnology, biotechnology, cognitive science, psychotechnology,
                            robotics, and artificial intelligence.
                            <br>New technological fields may result from the technological convergence of different
                            systems evolving towards similar goals. Convergence brings previously separate technologies
                            such as voice (and telephony features),
                            data (and productivity applications) and video together so that they share resources and
                            interact with each other, creating new efficiencies.
                            <br>Emerging technologies are those technical innovations which represent progressive
                            developments within a field for competitive advantage;[3] converging technologies represent
                            previously distinct fields which are
                            in some way moving towards stronger inter-connection and similar goals. However, the opinion
                            on the degree of the impact, status and economic viability of several emerging and
                            converging technologies varies.</p>
